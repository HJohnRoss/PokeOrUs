    This is an MVP of an Issue Tracking System I am building that sorts issue according to a "low, medium, high" severity system and OS with Admin and Tech/User access.
    I wanted to begin building my own ITS as I have used quite a few with different companies and I have always found them lacking certain criteria/details that would be beneficial to building an effective troubleshooting plan per issue. This is just the beginning of this project and as I use it for my own projects, I anticipate scaling it up along the way.
    
    This is a MVP of a website where users can favorite theyre favorite pokémon and buy merch of theyre favorite pokémon, this project was my first and definetly not my last, I used this project to learn Stripe API so I could implimant it in a bigger scale project later on. It uses a many to many relationship with flask with users being able to like theyre favorite pokémon and show the users favorite pokémon
