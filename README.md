    This is a MVP of a website where users can favorite theyre favorite pokémon and buy merch of theyre favorite pokémon, this project was my first and definetly not my last, I used this project to learn Stripe API so I could implimant it in a bigger scale project later on. It uses a many to many relationship with flask with users being able to like theyre favorite pokémon and show the users favorite pokémon
