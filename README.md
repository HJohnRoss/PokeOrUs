<h3 align="center">Poké Or Us</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is a MVP of a website where users can favorite their favorite pokémon and buy merch of their favorite pokémon, this project was my first and definetly not my last, I used this project to learn Stripe API so I could implimant it in a bigger scale project later on. It uses a many to many relationship with flask with users being able to like their favorite pokémon and show the users favorite pokémon
